[Note: This is a placeholder for the actual PNG file, which would be a bar chart showing 7 passed tests (green) and 2 failed tests (red). To generate this locally, run the `ai_validation_pipeline.py` script, which creates `validation_results.png`. For submission, include the actual PNG file generated by running the code.]
