# Project Overview: AI Validation Pipeline for Cinemo GmbH

## Purpose
This project, developed for the AI Validation Engineer role at Cinemo GmbH, demonstrates my ability to design and execute a validation pipeline for AI-driven automotive infotainment systems. It validates a voice command recognition model, simulating real-world scenarios relevant to Cinemo’s unified middleware solutions for multimedia playback and connectivity.

## Relevance to Cinemo
- **Automotive Infotainment**: The pipeline tests voice commands (e.g., “play music,” “navigate to”) under conditions like noise, accents, and multilingual inputs (English, German, Spanish), mirroring the diverse use cases in Cinemo’s in-car infotainment systems.
- **Quality Assurance**: It includes comprehensive test cases, detailed reporting (CSV, logs, visualizations), and pass/fail metrics, aligning with the role’s focus on ensuring high-quality AI performance.
- **Embedded Systems**: The code is optimized for constrained environments, avoiding network calls and using a lightweight model (`wav2vec2-base-960h`) with a mock fallback, reflecting Cinemo’s expertise in embedded automotive solutions.
- **Scalability**: The modular design can be integrated with Cinemo’s middleware, extended for real audio inputs, or adapted for other AI models used in infotainment.

## Why This Project?
This project showcases my skills in:
- Designing test cases for AI validation, including edge cases like noisy or multilingual inputs.
- Validating machine learning models for accuracy and robustness, critical for automotive-grade software.
- Producing professional documentation and visualizations, ensuring clear communication of results.
- Optimizing code for embedded systems, aligning with Cinemo’s focus on low-footprint infotainment solutions.

The included `RUN_GUIDE.md` and `sample_outputs/` folder make it easy to run and review the project, while this overview connects it to Cinemo’s mission of delivering seamless multimedia experiences in vehicles.
